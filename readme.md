Run Selenium Standalon programatically example

This is just the example extracted from the [Selenium Standalone](https://github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone) repo

I don't yet understand half of the options to `install` or `start` so no guarantees.

### How to use

`$ yarn install`

then 

`$ node start`
